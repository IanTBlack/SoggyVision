If the sample gap exceeds 250 milliseconds or if the buffer length exceeds more than a single packet length, then the data is flagged as SUSPECT. A substantially long buffer length indicates an issue in data acquistion, as data is being collected faster than it can be displayed/logged. 1 = PASS, 2 = NOT_EVALUATED, 3 = SUSPECT, 4 = FAIL, 9 = MISSING

flag_gross_range_test_a_m:
  description: --THIS TEST SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN AT FACE VALUE FOR PUBLICATIONS.-- Instead, it can be used to diagnose AC (alternating current) noise and other sensor issues. The gross range test is performed on each value at each wavelength bin, thus maintaining the same shape as the time and wavelength dimensions. The dynamic range of an ACS is 0.001 to 10, but vales between -0.005 and 0 have been deemed acceptable by the manufacturer after correction. The ACS sensor has been known to drift over time, both in the field and in storage, making regular blank calibrations important. NOTE -- This test has been performed on data that has NOT received additional temperature-salinity-scattering correction. After proper correction, the gross range test should be applied again.

Data taken between 60-240 seconds is flagged as suspect (3).
